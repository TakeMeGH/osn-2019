<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
  Pak Dengklek is organizing a party at his place. This party is attended by N + M guests, numbered
  1 to N + M. The guests numbered 1 to N are male guests, while the guests numbered N + 1 to N + M
  are female guests.
</p><p>
  Each guest gets acquainted with zero or more other guests that have the opposite gender. If the
  guest x gets acquainted with guest y, then guest y also gets acquainted with guest x. Since the
  duration of the party is quite short, usually each guest gets acquainted by exactly one other
  guest. A guest is said to be unusual if the guest does not get acquainted with other guests or
  gets acquainted with more than one other guests.
</p><p>
  After checking the guest list, Pak Dengklek notices that the number of male guests is not the same
  as the number of female guests. Therefore, there must be at least one unusual guest. You want to
  help Pak Dengklek to identify any unusual guest.
</p><p>
  You can ask at most Q questions to Pak Dengklek. For each question, you can ask a set of guests.
  Pak Dengklek will answer the set of guests that get acquainted with at least one guest in the
  set. In other words, if you ask a set of guests A, then a guest y will be in the set answered by
  Pak Dengklek if and only if there is a guest x in the set A and guest x gets acquainted with guest
  y.

<h3>Problem Type Information</h3>
<p>
  This is an "interactive" problem. In this problem, you will interact with the judge's program
  through standard input (stdin) and standard output (stdout). See the following interaction format
  carefully.
</p>

<h3>Interaction Format</h3>
<p>
  In the beginning, the values of N, M, and Q will be given from standard input in the following format:
</p>
<pre>
N M Q
</pre>
<p>
  Then, not more than Q times, you can output to standard output in the following format:
</p>
<pre>
? X A[1] A[2] ... A[X]
</pre>
<p>
  This means you ask the set of guests {A[1], A[2], ..., A[X]} to Pak Dengklek. The values of
  A[1], A[2], ..., A[X] asked have to satisfy 1 &le; A[1] &lt; A[2] &lt; ... &lt; A[X] &le; N + M.
  The set B = {B[1], B[2], ..., B[Y]} (the set answered by Pak Dengklek) will be given from standard
  input in the following format:
</p>
<pre>
Y B[1] B[2] ... B[Y]
</pre>
<p>
  The values of B[1], B[2], ..., B[Y] are guaranteed to satisfy
  1 &le; B[1] &lt; B[2] &lt; ... &lt; B[Y] &le; N + M. In the end, your answer has to be outputted
  to standard output in the following format:
</p>
<pre>
! Z
</pre>
<p>
  This means you guess that the guest Z is an unusual guest. Your answer will be considered as
  correct if the guest Z does not get acquainted with other guests or gets acquainted with more than
  one other guests.
</p>

<h3>Interaction Sample 1</h3>
<p>
  In the following sample, N = 3, M = 5, Q = 7, dan
  <ul>
    <li>The first guest gets acquainted with the fourth guest.</li>
    <li>The second guest gets acquainted with the fifth, sixth, and eighth guests.</li>
    <li>The third guest gets acquainted with the sixth guest.</li>
    <li>The fourth guest gets acquainted with the first guest.</li>
    <li>The fifth guest gets acquainted with the second guest.</li>
    <li>The sixth guest gets acquainted with the second and third guests.</li>
    <li>The seventh guest does not get acquainted with other guests.</li>
    <li>The eighth guest gets acquainted with the second guest.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  As a note, <code>! 2</code> or <code>! 6</code> in the last line is also a correct output.
</p>

<h3>Subtasks</h3>
<p>
  For all subtasks:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>1 &le; N, M &le; 50.</li>
  <li>N &ne; M.</li>
  <li>Q = 7.</li>
  <li>Each guest gets acquainted only with guests that have the opposite gender.</li>
</ul>

<subtask1/>
<ul>
  <li>N = 1.</li>
</ul>

<subtask2/>
<ul>
  <li>N, M &le; 4.</li>
</ul>

<subtask3/>
<ul>
  <li>N, M &le; 8.</li>
</ul>

<subtask4/>
<ul>
  <li>No additional constraints.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Note</h3>
<p>
  For each test case, denote P as the number of questions you ask to Pak Dengklek. If you correctly
  guess the unusual guest and P &le; Q, then you will receive an <b>AC</b> verdict. If P > Q, then
  you will receive a WA verdict and a "P > Q" message on the grader. If you do not correctly guess
  the unusual guest, or the values of A[1], A[2], ..., A[X] that you output do not satisfy 
  1 &le; A[1] &lt; A[2] &lt; ... &lt; A[X] &le; N + M, then you will receive a <b>WA</b> verdict and
  no message on the grader.
</p>

<h3>Warning</h3>
<p>
  Always <i>flush</i> after each output.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pascal:<pre>flush(output);</pre></li>
  <li>C/C++:
      <ul>
        <li>for <code>stdio.h</code> (<code>cstdio</code>) library:<pre>fflush(stdout);</pre></li>
        <li>for <code>iostream</code> library:<pre>std::cout << std::flush;</pre></li>
