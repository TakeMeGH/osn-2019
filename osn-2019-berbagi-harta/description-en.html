<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
  You and Pak Dengklek have just found a treasure chest. Inside the chest, there are N distinct
  items, numbered 1 to N. The i-th item has a value of H[i].
</p><p>
  Among these N items, there are P items that you like, those items numbered A[1], A[2], ..., and
  A[P]. Similarly, there are Q items that Pak Dengklek like, those items numbered B[1], B[2], ...,
  and B[Q]. Each item is guaranteed to be liked by either you or Pak Dengklek (or both).
</p><p>
  Starting from you, you and Pak Dengklek will alternatingly take one of the items that has not
  been taken before. You can only take an item that you like. If there is no item that you like and
  has not been taken, then you have to skip your turn. Similarly, Pak Dengklek can only take an
  item that he likes. Pak Dengklek also has to skip his turn if there is no item that he likes and
  has not been taken.
</p><p>
  You and Pak Dengklek will stop taking the items when there is no more item left. Compute the
  maximum total item value that you can take if Pak Dengklek also tries to maximize the total item
  value that he takes.
</p>

<h3>Input Format</h3>
<p>
  The input is given with the following format:
</p>
<pre>
N P Q
H[1] H[2] ... H[N]
A[1] A[2] ... A[P]
B[1] B[2] ... B[Q]
</pre>

<h3>Output Format</h3>
<p>
  A single line containing the maximum total item value that you can take if Pak Dengklek also tries
  to maximize the total item value that he takes.
</p>

<h3>Explanation of Sample 1</h3>
<p>
  The following is a possible scenario:
  <ul>
    <li>In the first turn, you can take the third item and Pak Dengklek can take the fifth item.
    </li>
    <li>In the second turn, you can take the first item and Pak Dengklek can take the second item.
    </li>
    <li>In the third turn, you can take the sixth item and Pak Dengklek can take the fourth item.
    </li>
    <li>In the fourth turn, you cannot take an item and Pak Dengklek can take the seventh item.
    </li>
  </ul>
  All items have been taken and you take a total item value of H[3] + H[1] + H[6] = 6 + 1 + 2 = 9.
  There is no way for you to take a total item value of more than 9.
