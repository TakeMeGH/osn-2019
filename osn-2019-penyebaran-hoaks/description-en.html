<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
  Pak Dengklek has just developed a social media site. There are N users using the site, numbered 1
  to N. There are S hours in one day. All of these users have a fixed usage schedule from day to
  day. Therefore, the i-th user will be online T[i] times every day:
  <ul>
    <li>from the start of the A[i][1]-th hour to the end of the B[i][1]-th hour,</li>
    <li>from the start of the A[i][2]-th hour to the end of the B[i][2]-th hour,</li>
    <li>...</li>
    <li>and from the start of the A[i][T[i]]-th hour to the end of the B[i][T[i]]-th hour.</li>
  </ul>
</p><p>
  At any time, all users on the site like to share news to all other online users. Unfortunately,
  one of the N users has a hoax at the start of the first day and will spread it. Hence, all users
  who meet the user with the hoax will also have the hoax at the end of the first day. Two users are
  stated to be met if there is at least an hour where the two users are both online.
</p><p>
  This hoax will also be spread on the second day. Therefore, all users who meet the user with the
  hoax at the end of the first day will also have the hoax at the end of the second day. This
  continued the following days.
</p><p>
  There are Q scenarios, numbered 1 to Q. On the i-th scenario, the user who has the hoax at the
  start of the first day is the P[i]-th user. A different scenario might cause a different hoax
  spreading. Therefore, for each scenario, Pak Dengklek wonders on the number of users with the hoax
  at the end of the N-th day, where N is the number of users.

<h3>Input Format</h3>
<p>
  The input is given with the following format:
</p>
<pre>
N S Q
T[1] A[1][1] B[1][1] A[1][2] B[1][2] ... A[1][T[1]] B[1][T[1]]
T[2] A[2][1] B[2][1] A[2][2] B[2][2] ... A[2][T[2]] B[2][T[2]]
.

T[N] A[N][1] B[N][1] A[N][2] B[N][2] ... A[N][T[N]] B[N][T[N]]
P[1]
P[2]
.
.
.
P[Q]
</pre>

<h3>Output Format</h3>
<p>
  Q lines: the i-th line contains the number of users with the hoax at the end of the N-th day on
  the i-th scenario.
</p>

<samplecase1/>

<h3>Explanation of Sample 1</h3>
<p>
  On the first scenario, the first user meets the second user (at the second hour to the third hour)
  and the fourth user (at the ninth hour). Therefore, at the end of the first day, the two users
  will have the hoax. The second user also meets the third user (at the first hour). Therefore, at
  the end of the second day, the third user will also have the hoax. There will be no hoax spreading
  on the third, fourth, and fifth day, thus 4 users will have the hoax at the end of the fifth day.
</p><p>
  On the second scenario, the fifth user does not meet other users, thus other users will not have
  the hoax.
