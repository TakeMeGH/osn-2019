<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
  The OSN competition will begin soon! Chairs have been arranged to form a rectangle containing R
  rows (numbered 1 to R) &times; C columns (numbered 1 to C) inside the contest hall. Each chair
  might be empty or be occupied by an OSN contestant.
</p><p>
  The condition of all chairs in the contest hall at this point can be represented by a matrix S. If
  the chair in the i-th row and the j-th column is empty at this point, then S[i][j] contains a
  character <code>0</code>. Otherwise, if the chair in the i-th row and the j-th column is occupied
  by a contestant at this point, then S[i][j] contains a character <code>1</code>.
</p><p>
  Pak Dengklek wants to brief the OSN contestants. Looking at the distributed seating of the OSN
  contestants, Pak Dengklek will gather them first before the briefing. Pak Dengklek wants all
  contestants to be gathered in one rectangle. In other words, all contestants sit between the
  r<sub>1</sub>-th to r<sub>2</sub>-th row and the c<sub>1</sub>-th to c<sub>2</sub>-th column (for
  some value 1 &le; r<sub>1</sub> &le; r<sub>2</sub> &le; R and
  1 &le; c<sub>1</sub> &le; c<sub>2</sub> &le; C), and there is no empty chair inside the mentioned
  row and column ranges.
</p><p>
  To gather the contestants, Pak Dengklek might have to move some of the contestants to any empty
  seat. Pak Dengklek wants to move as few contestants as possible since each movement disturbs other
  contestants. Pak Dengklek is wondering about the minimum number of movements that have to be done
  for all contestants to be gathered in one rectangle, or if it is impossible to do so.

  The input is given with the following format:
</p>
<pre>
R C
S[1][1]S[1][2]...S[1][C]
S[2][1]S[2][2]...S[2][C]
.             .  .
.              . .

S[R][1]S[R][2]...S[R][C]
</pre>

<h3>Output Format</h3>
<p>
  A single line containing the minimum number of movements that have to be done for all contestants
  to be gathered in one rectangle, or <code>-1</code> if it is impossible to do so.
</p>

<samplecase1/>

<h3>Explanation of Sample 1</h3>
<p>
  In this sample, all contestants have gathered in one rectangle, so no movement has to be done.
</p>

<samplecase2/>

<h3>Explanation of Sample 2</h3>
<p>
  In this sample, Pak Dengklek can move the contestant sitting in the first row and the third column
  to the seat in the third row and the first column. After the move, all contestants have gathered
  in one rectangle, so only 1 movement has to be done.
</p>

<h3>Explanation of Sample 3</h3>
<p>
  In this sample, there is no way to gather all contestants in one rectangle.
