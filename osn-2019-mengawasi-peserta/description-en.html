<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
  The OSN competition will begin soon! Chairs have been arranged to form a rectangle containing R
  rows (numbered 1 to R from north to south) &times; C columns (numbered 1 to C from west to east)
  inside the contest hall. The chair in the i-th row and the j-th column is provided for an OSN
  contestant if (i + j) is odd and provided for an OSN invigilator if (i + j) is even.
</p><p>
  Each chair provided for an OSN invigilator is still empty at this point. Each chair provided for
  an OSN contestant might be empty or be occupied by an OSN contestant. There is at least one OSN
  contestant.
</p><p>
  The condition of all chairs in the contest hall at this point can be represented by a matrix S. If
  the chair in the i-th row and the j-th column is empty at this point, then S[i][j] contains a
  character <code>.</code>. Otherwise, if the chair in the i-th row and the j-th column is occupied
  by a contestant at this point, then S[i][j] contains a character <code>x</code>.
</p><p>
  You want to invigilate all the OSN contestants. Therefore, for all chairs provided for an OSN
  invigilator, you can put an invigilator and determine the sitting direction of the invigilator.
  Invigilator sitting in the i-th row and the j-th column can invigilate:
  <ul>
    <li>An OSN contestant sitting in the (i + 1)-th row and the j-th column, if the invigilator
        sits to the south.</li>
    <li>An OSN contestant sitting in the (i - 1)-th row and the j-th column, if the invigilator
        sits to the north.</li>
    <li>An OSN contestant sitting in the i-th row and the (j + 1)-th column, if the invigilator
        sits to the east.</li>
    <li>An OSN contestant sitting in the i-th row and the (j - 1)-th column, if the invigilator
        sits to the west.</li>
  </ul>
</p><p>
  Your score will depend on the number of OSN contestants that are invigilated by at least one
  invigilator, using a formula that will be explained in the Scoring section.
</p>

<h3>Problem Type Information</h3>
<p>
  This is an "output-only" problem. For each test case, you write the output to a file.
</p><p>
  The input files for this problem can be downloaded <a href="render/inputs.zip">here</a>. Inside
  the .zip file, there are 1 + 5 input files to solve: mengawasi_sample_1.in,
  mengawasi_1.in, mengawasi_2.in, ..., mengawasi_5.in. The sample input (mengawasi_sample_1.in) is
  not included in the final score.
</p><p>
  For each input file that you solve (you don't have to solve all input files), create an output
  file mengawasi_sample_X.out (for sample input) or mengawasi_X.out, where X
  is the test case number. Then, compress all files into a single .zip file, and submit.
</p>

<h3>Input Format</h3>
<p>
  The input is given with the following format:
</p>
<pre>
R C
S[1][1]S[1][2]...S[1][C]
S[2][1]S[2][2]...S[2][C]
.             .  .
.              . .
.               ..
S[R][1]S[R][2]...S[R][C]
</pre>

<h3>Output Format</h3>
<p>
  R lines: the i-th line contains C characters. The j-th character in the i-th line is:
  <ul>
    <li><code>.</code> if the chair in the i-th row and the j-th column is initially empty and you
        let it to be empty.</li>
    <li><code>x</code> if the chair in the i-th row and the j-th column is occupied by an OSN
        contestant.</li>
    <li><code>v</code> if the chair in the i-th row and the j-th column is initially empty and you
        put an invigilator on the chair sitting to the south.</li>
    <li><code>^</code> if the chair in the i-th row and the j-th column is initially empty and you
        put an invigilator on the chair sitting to the north.</li>
    <li><code>></code> if the chair in the i-th row and the j-th column is initially empty and you
        put an invigilator on the chair sitting to the east.</li>
    <li><code><</code> if the chair in the i-th row and the j-th column is initially empty and you
        put an invigilator on the chair sitting to the west.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h3>Explanation of Sample 1</h3>
<p>
  The following output is also a correct output.

</pre>

<h3>Scoring</h3>
<p>
  Your output will achieve a score on a test case if your output follows the specified output format
  and satisfies all the following conditions:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>If S[i][j] = <code>.</code> and (i + j) is odd, then the j-th character in the i-th row of
      your output is <code>.</code>.</li>
  <li>If S[i][j] = <code>.</code> and (i + j) is even, then the j-th character in the i-th row of
      your output is either <code>.</code>, <code>v</code>, <code>^</code>, <code>></code>, or
      <code><</code>.</li>
  <li>If S[i][j] = <code>x</code>, then the j-th character in the i-th row of your output is
      <code>x</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  If P is the number of OSN contestants that are invigilated by at least one invigilator in your
  solution, and Q is the number of maximum OSN contestants that can be invigilated by at least one
  invigilator in an optimal solution, then your score is:
</p>
<table border="1">
  <thead>
    <th>Condition</th>
    <th>Points</th>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>P = Q</td><td>20</td></tr>
    <tr><td>P &lt; Q</td><td><img src="render/formula.gif"/></td></tr>
    <!--LaTeX: \left\lfloor 20 \times \left( \frac{P}{Q} \right )^4 \right\rfloor -->
